# Aleat贸rio - MVP

## Overview
Aleat贸rio is an MVP designed to validate functionalities by extending OutSystems (OS) code to C# and testing external multi-form calls to mitigate CORS issues. This project serves as an initial step towards demonstrating the feasibility of integrating advanced features into OS applications through external C# extensions.

## Features
- **C# Extension for OS**: Demonstrates how to extend OS functionalities using C#.
- **External API Calls**: Tests external multi-form API calls to understand and mitigate potential CORS problems.

## Objective
The primary objective of Aleat贸rio is to explore and validate the integration of OS with external C# extensions, ensuring seamless communication and data exchange between OS applications and external services.

## Next Steps
- **Code Refactoring**: The code will be refactored to adhere more closely to the standards expected for inclusion in the ODC Forge.
- **Enhanced Functionality**: Additional features and functionalities will be explored and potentially added to demonstrate further the capabilities of integrating OS with C#.
- **Forge Readiness**: Preparing the extension for submission to the ODC Forge, ensuring compliance with guidelines and best practices.

## Note
This MVP is a starting point for discussions and development towards more robust solutions that leverage external extensions. Feedback and contributions are welcome to evolve Aleat贸rio into a more comprehensive tool for the OS community.
